        <h2>Pandemic Era Classes: WOW C++</h2>
        <p> As I embark on my IT journey during the pandemic year 2021, was both challenging and exhilarating.
         As a freshman and later on a sophomore navigating the world of online classes, I was thrust into a new mode of learning which tested my adaptability and self-discipline in every aspect of the online classes.
          Despite the technical challenges and isolation, this period have become a formative chapter in my growth in my early years in college. I found excitement in exploring new software, I can remember being so diligent in learning programming languages, 
          troubleshooting problems on my own and with the help of a group of friends I have found, and discovering the vast potential of technology in group collaboration. Those early years taught me not just about programming or systems, nor the basics and foundations of all the things I needed to learn, but also about resilience and the power of continuous learning even in uncertain times.

        <h2>Software Engineering: Life and Death Experience</h2>
        <p> My software engineering experience, where I took on the roles of tester, data analyst, and at times, project manager, was one of the most challenging chapters in my academic journey. We were tasked with developing a client-based system titled "FJ Films Wedding Photography and Videography Reservation and Booking Management System." Despite our best efforts, we faced a significant hurdle in meeting the client's expectations and deadlines due to insufficient consultation with both our adviser and the client. This gap in communication exposed critical issues in our development process and ultimately became a valuable lesson for us to learn. This experience underscored the importance of constant feedback, clarity in requirements, 
        communication among us group members, and maintaining close collaboration—principles that are essential in the real-world IT industry.

        <p>My capstone journey as the project manager of our system titled "Web-Based Platform for Award Applications: 
        Enhancing Accessibility and Efficiency in Higher Education" was a truly wholesome and fulfilling experience. I was fortunate to be teamed up with responsible and dedicated individuals I could rely on, making the entire process collaborative and smooth. As the project lead, I played an active role in conceptualizing the system, designing the user interface, writing the necessary documentation, and coordinating consultations with our adviser. This experience not only sharpened my technical and leadership skills but also reinforced the value of teamwork, accountability, 
        and clear communication in bringing a project from idea to reality, especially with the right people.

        <h2>On-the Job Training ",</h2>
        <p>My OJT journey at the WMSU Alumni Association was a pivotal experience in my growth as an IT student. Tasked with developing a content management system, our team faced some technical and logistical challenges. It was a demanding project and we were time constraint since we were the last group to have been given a client or designation to an office. Our team was pushed to apply what we had learned in the classroom to a real-world setting, and even beyond. What stood out most during this time was the importance of proper coordination and communication within the group. I realized that no amount of coding skill could replace the value of teamwork, planning, and clear collaboration.
        This experience not only strengthened our team's technical abilities but also shaped our perspective on working effectively in a professional environment.

        <p>Looking back at my overall IT journey, I can truly say it has been a path filled with growth, challenges, and rewarding experiences. From adapting to a whole different mode of online classes during the pandemic in my freshman and sophomore years, to taking on real-world projects during my OJT, each phase has shaped me into an individual I am today. I’ve had the chance to wear many hats—project manager, tester, data analyst, designer—and through it all, I’ve learned the true value of collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning—a never-ending learning. Whether it was leading our capstone project with a reliable team or facing tough lessons in our software engineering course, every step has prepared me for the dynamic and ever-evolving world of IT. 
        This journey has not only honed my technical abilities but also built my character, preparing me to take on greater challenges ahead.

      <p>Looking back, my IT journey wasn’t always smooth—but it was real, meaningful, and full of growth. From the quiet struggles of online classes during the pandemic to leading projects and facing real-world challenges,
       I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel lost sometimes. It's okay not to be okay. Progress doesn’t always look like success—it often looks like small steps, late nights, breakdowns, and lessons learned the hard way. What mattered most were the people I worked with, the values I discovered, and the quiet confidence I gained along the way. If you’re on your own journey, take heart—growth takes time, and you're doing better than you think.

      <h2>One Journey, Many Lessons: My Full IT Story</h2>
      <p>My IT journey has been anything but linear—from learning the basics of programming during the pandemic, to leading our capstone project and navigating the real-world demands of OJT. Each chapter brought its own set of challenges and lessons. 
  
      I started during the height of the pandemic, where online classes forced me to become independent and resourceful. Discovering the world of C++ and problem-solving sparked my interest in programming, and collaboration with peers kept me going through the isolation.
  
      Then came Software Engineering—a tough reality check. Miscommunication, pressure, and tight deadlines taught me how critical planning and teamwork are in real-world projects. That project, although difficult, was a turning point in how I viewed system development.
  
      As project manager of our capstone, I learned to lead with clarity and empathy. It was a rewarding challenge that brought out the best in me and my team. Our shared goal kept us aligned, and I saw what good leadership and teamwork could really achieve.
  
      During OJT, theory turned into practice. We developed a CMS under time constraints, with real client expectations. It was stressful but incredibly eye-opening. The importance of communication and adaptability stood out even more.
  
      Through it all, I grew—not just technically, but personally. I’ve worn many hats, faced doubts, and embraced discomfort. Even when things felt unclear, I pushed forward. And that taught me that growth isn’t about perfection—it’s about persistence.
  
      This journey molded me into someone who’s ready to face bigger challenges. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and grateful for every struggle that taught me something new.
